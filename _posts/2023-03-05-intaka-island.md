# Century City

Century City is advertised as a "Smart City" and is situated right next to Canal
Walk, one of the largest shopping centres in the country which I frequently
visit.

It is not a widely advertised city so not everyone knows about it. Cape Town is
a popular destination for many South Africans looking to relocate due to it's
relatively good governance and scenery amongst other things.

Unfortunately South Africa is currently dealing with a failing national power
grid and eskom (our state power utility) has had to implement so called
'loadshedding' where certain parts of the grid are switched off for a few hours
at a time.

As of today you can expect up to 4-6 hours of power cuts per day which is
especially damaging for small businesses and resturants. I really do hope this
gets better!

Anyways... It has been just over a year now since I started working as a
professional. I have learned so much in one year already and I am excited to see
what the future holds. If you asked me if I preferred university to the working
world more I would definately say working!

I mean no more exam stress! What's not to like, right? It's amazing how many
years of our life we spend on education. I believe this is due to the increasing
complexity of the modern world and starting a business in the 21'st century
requires technical skills.

More and more people are also realising the value of a college education which
is why university enrollment is off the charts! Obviously universities have
limited resources and so I feel like alternative pathways to learning will
emerge.

In a sense they already have, just look at bootcamp enrollment, the stats are
crazy.

# New Camera

So.. As you might not know, I have a youtube channel under the name "[Lunar
Journal](https://www.youtube.com/@lunarjournal)". I don't have anything of
significance on there as of yet but I am planning on documenting some of my
personal software and electronics projects to grow my youtube channel.

To achieve these objectives I have been saving up for a decent quality camera
and decided to settle on the canon `M50 Mark II`. So far it is a great camera.
Most budget camera's have limited 4K capability, but this camera does support 4K
@ 25 FPS.

25FPS is a little too low in my opinion because videos do not appear 'smooth' at
such a low FPS which is why I decided to record my content in 1080 HD @ 60 FPS.
I look forward to creating new content for my channel.

I decided to take a few photos to test the Canon M50 MK II out. Images (in JPG
format) are typically around 15MB which is obviously too large for a blog so I
have compressed them down for the blog to around 200KB each.

The goal of this blog has always been to be lightweight and so I do not want a
user to wait too long to load content. Anyway I am going to sign off now, so
here are the photos (I am really impressed with the quality):
