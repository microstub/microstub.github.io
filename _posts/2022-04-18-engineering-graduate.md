<div class="brief" markdown="1">
So that day finally arrived, a day I will never forget. After checking my
university email sometime in the afternoon I came across an email titled
'March 2022 Graduation Documents'. I was eagarly awaiting this email.

# Background

It read:

```
Dear Graduate

Congratulations on your graduation!

Kindly find the following attached:

1.  Official copy of your degree certificate
2.  Official UCT academic transcript
```

The story begins in high school where I had two options for my final year,
either take the South African
[NSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculation_in_South_Africa#Curriculum)
(National Senior Certificate) or take the international Cambridge
[AS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Level) levels. Looking through the
curriculums it seemed to me that the AS levels would prepare me for engineering
school better as the curriculum seemed more advanced.

You see from an early age I knew that I wanted to study engineering. As a young
kid I would buy electronic components such as LEDs and switches and with the
help of my grandmother would build breadboard circuits. Gradually these circuits
would become more complex, from simple LEDs to transistor circuits.

You would often find me taking electronic equipment apart in the house which
somewhat annoyed my mother, but she was very supportive of my interest in
electronics. However I did not have a mathematical basis  to my understanding of
electronics and as I grew older I started to do more research.

By the time I was nearly finished with highschool  I was writing operating
systems/kernels in C/C++ and building RF transmitters/receivers. My interest in
engineering was only growing and I knew that I had to perform well enough to get
into a good university.

After my first year at the University of Pretoria my brother got accepted into
UCT to study medicine. I then had the idea of transferring to UCT since I did
well enough in my first year at tuks. So I sent through my application for a
BSc(Eng) in Electrical Engineering and it was accepted!

At this point I was very excited to be starting at UCT. It had always been my
dream university. I had the task of getting exemption for my credits completed
at the University of Pretoria but quickly found out that I had to in fact go
back into first year. This was apparently because there were too many
differences in course work between the universities.

If I could summarise engineering school it would be tough but interesting. If
anything university has taught me to persevere through difficult times and that
with the right mindset you can accomplish anything.

Not to mention the social skills you pick up by working with your fellow peers
on group assignments and labs. University is truly an amazing (but financially
and mentally costly!) experience but ultimately I would recommend it to anyone.

In this day and age the job market is very competitive and I truly believe that
a STEM degree is a very valuable asset to have if you can make it all the way to
the end. However it seems that as knowledge and education are open sourced, more
non-traditional pathways to the job market are emerging.

For example bootcamps and short courses are becoming increasingly popular
amongst South Africans. It will be interesting to see how the higher education
landscape will change in the future. I've recently learned about a non profit
[WeThinkCode_](https://www.wethinkcode.co.za).

Apparently you complete 2 online tasks/games and if you do well enough get an
email inviting you to an intensive 4 week bootcamp in which selection takes
place. Anyone is allowed to apply, even if you don't have a matric.

# GPA

Overall I am very proud to have made it through engineering school and I
graduated in 2021 from UCT with a degree in electrical and computer engineering
and a cumulative GPA of 62.58% across both universities (see calculation below):

```
University of Pretoria Credits: 148
University of Pretoria GPA: 68.03%

Unviersity of Cape Town Credits: 586
University of Cape Town GPA: 61.20%

Total Credits: 734
Cumulative GPA: 62.58%
```

$$ \dfrac{61.20\cdot 586+68.03\cdot 148}{586+148}\simeq 62.58\% $$

Following this US grade [translation
table](https://web.archive.org/web/20090429052200/http://www.uct.ac.za/apply/intlapplicants/semester/overview/credit)
for UCT my overall GPA would be roughly 3.0 (US B Grade) on a 4 point scale.

# Notes

Some universities across South Africa such as UCT and Wits offer a BSc in
Engineering while others such as the University of Pretoria (UP) offer a
Bachelors of Engineering (BEng).

After having completed a year in each of these programs I will say that from my
experience the BSc(Eng) seems to focus more on theory than the BEng.

I distinctly remember having more proofs in tests at UCT than at UP, although
this could be due to departmental differences accross the universities rather
than the degree programs themself.

If you are curious as to what courses you do as part of an engineering degree at
UCT you can find this info
[here](http://www.students.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/434/study/handbooks/2022/2022_EBE_UG_Handbook.pdf).

You can verify my degree using the [UCT Public
